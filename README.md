# MercaDeals App

Still a work in progress. ðŸš€ðŸ˜€

I initially was to use the provided api from Merca but it became a bit of an issue for me because of the language barrier. I ended up using the fake store api, https://fakestoreapi.com/docs

There are several endpoints that I did not get to use because of time. And I would to explore when time allow it. 

### The Tech stack I have used, 

- Jetpack Compose for UI,
- Jetpack Libraries 

        - Navigation  
        - Flow
        - Coroutines 
             
- Coil for Image Caching 
- Dagger Hilt
- Accompanist pager library
- Lottie Animations
- Retrofit

### Architecture

- I used an MVVM architecture, and I was able to divide the different layers to observe a clean architecture, data, domain, presentation. 

#### Feedback
I got carried away and as I might not have achieved one or two requirements because of the errors I faced along the way, I hope to finish the app with time.
I really enjoyed working on the task. 

### User Journey 

Upon Installation, you will be able to see an onboarding screen, you can continue as a guest, I had a few problems with working with the authentication bit. With internet connection, you willl be able to view the home page. Due to time, there are several partd I wasn't able to finish up on due to time.
